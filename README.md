## 🎯 Why ScreenerBot?

**The Problem:**

Most Solana trading tools rely on delayed API data, run on shared cloud infrastructure, and force you to trust third-party platforms with your assets. For professional traders, these limitations cost real money every day.

**The Solution:**

ScreenerBot is a **local application** that runs on **your hardware**, calculates prices **directly from blockchain data**, and executes trades **through your wallet**—no platforms, no custody, no delays.

### Built for Performance

- 🦀 **Written in Rust** — Same systems language as Solana itself
- ⚡ **Native Runtime** — Compiled to machine code like C/C++ for maximum speed
- 🔗 **Official Solana SDK** — Direct integration with blockchain libraries
- 💻 **Local Execution** — Your hardware, your speed, your control

### Built for Accuracy

- 📊 **Direct Pool Calculation** — 3-100% more accurate than aggregators
- 🔄 **Real-Time Pricing** — Calculate from pool reserves in <50ms
- 📡 **Multi-Source Validation** — DexScreener + GeckoTerminal + RugCheck + On-chain
- 🎯 **Zero Aggregator Lag** — See actual tradeable prices, not stale data

### Built for Security

- 🔐 **Self-Custody** — Private keys never leave your machine
- 🛡️ **Pre-Trade Validation** — Automatic security checks before every entry
- 🚫 **Auto-Blacklisting** — Detect and avoid problematic tokens
- ✅ **RugCheck Integration** — Real-time security analysis

### Data Flow

**Price Calculation:**
1. Fetch pool account data from Solana RPC (100-200ms)
2. Decode reserves using DEX-specific layouts (1-5ms)
3. Calculate spot price from reserve ratios (1-2ms)
4. Background refresh every 0.5 seconds
5. **Total: <250ms from request to result**

**Trade Execution:**
1. Strategy signals entry/exit condition
2. Query Jupiter + GMGN + Direct pools for best route (<500ms)
3. Build transaction locally with optimal parameters
4. Sign with local wallet
5. Submit directly to Solana RPC
6. **Total: <1 second from signal to blockchain**

### Performance Characteristics

| Operation | ScreenerBot | Typical Cloud Bot |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Price calculation | 5-50ms | 500-2000ms |
| Multi-pool query (50 pools) | 200-400ms | 2000-5000ms |
| Strategy evaluation | <10ms | 50-200ms |
| Trade decision → execution | <100ms | 500-1500ms |
| Database query (position lookup) | <1ms (local SSD) | 10-50ms (network) |

## ✨ Features

## ✨ Core Features

### 🎯 Direct Pool Pricing

**The Accuracy Advantage**

Traditional price aggregators (DexScreener, CoinGecko, etc.) introduce 30-60 second delays due to:
- Polling intervals (to reduce API costs)
- Processing and caching layers
- Serving thousands of concurrent users

**ScreenerBot calculates prices directly from blockchain data:**

- Fetches pool account state from Solana RPC every 0.5 seconds
- Decodes reserves using official DEX program layouts
- Calculates spot price using reserve ratios
- Active positions refreshed every 5 seconds

**Result: 3-100% more accurate pricing** compared to aggregators, especially for low-cap and volatile tokens.

### 🔄 Multi-Source Intelligence

**All Data, One Platform**

| Source | Data Type | Update Frequency |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| 🔗 **Solana Blockchain** | Pool reserves, liquidity, on-chain pricing | Every 0.5s (positions: 5s) |
| 🔍 **DexScreener** | Market data, volume, trending tokens | Priority-based |
| 🦎 **GeckoTerminal** | Pool information, token discovery | Priority-based |
| 🛡️ **RugCheck** | Security scores, authority checks | On-demand |
| 🪐 **Jupiter** | Swap routing, execution prices | Per-trade |
| 💧 **GMGN** | Alternative routing | Per-trade |

**Filter tokens across all sources simultaneously:**
- Set criteria once (liquidity, volume, security, age)
- ScreenerBot validates against all sources in parallel
- Get passed/rejected lists with detailed reasons
- Monitor hundreds of tokens 24/7 automatically

---

### 🎲 Strategy Engine

**Advanced Entry & Exit Logic**

**Entry Strategies:**
- Price conditions (breakouts, support/resistance)
- Volume conditions (unusual spikes, sustained trends)
- Liquidity conditions (minimum thresholds, growth rate)
- Security conditions (RugCheck scores, authority checks)
- Time conditions (age requirements, time-of-day filters)

**Exit Strategies:**

**1. Trailing Stop Loss** *(Protect Profits Dynamically)*
```
Entry: 0.0001 SOL
Price → 0.00015 SOL (+50%)
Trailing stop activates at +10% → Stop moves to 0.0001425 SOL (5% below peak)
Price drops to 0.0001425 SOL → Auto-exit, locking in +42.5% profit
```

**2. ROI-Based Take Profit** *(Fixed Targets)*
```
Entry: 0.0002 SOL
Target: +25%
Exit: 0.00025 SOL → Auto-exit when target reached
```

**3. Time-Based Override** *(Capital Efficiency)*
```
Entry: Token shows promise but consolidates
Max hold: 24 hours
After 24 hours → Auto-exit regardless of P&L, free capital for new trades
```

**DCA Support:**
- Add to positions at configured profit thresholds (+10%, +20%, +30%)
- Automatic cost basis tracking across multiple entries
- Partial exit support for taking profits incrementally
